Builds an ESRI "Portal For ArcGIS" Docker image that runs on Ubuntu Server.

2017-July-09

All four of the Geo-CEG repositories for the ArcGIS Enterprise project
have been combined into one,
[geo-ceg/docker-arcgis-enterprise](https://github.com/Geo-CEG/docker-arcgis-enterprise).

This was done to facilitate the use of Docker Compose.

This repo is being left here as a placeholder.
