# docker-portal-for-arcgis
Builds an ESRI "Portal For ArcGIS" Docker image that runs on Ubuntu Server.

## Build the Docker Image

You need to have two files downloaded from ESRI to build this docker image.

* Put the Linux installer downloaded from ESRI into the same file with Dockerfile;
this will be a file with a name like "Portal_for_ArcGIS_Linux_105_154053.tar.gz".

* Create a provisioning file for Portal For ArcGIS in your ESRI dashboard and download the file.
It will have an extension of ".prvc". Put the file in the same folder with the Dockerfile.

For example, I am using the Developer license, so to create the .prvc
file, I went to the "my.esri.com" web site, clicked the Developer tab,
then clicked "Create New Provisioning File" in the left nav bar.

* Build 

Now that you have added the proprietary files you can build an image, 
```
docker build -t geoceg/portal-for-arcgis .
```

## Run the container 

Run detached (as a daemon); for convenience I keep this command in a script, "startportal":
```
  docker run --name arcgis-portal \
  -d -p 7080:7080 -p 7443:7443 --net arcgis-network \
  geoceg/portal-for-arcgis
```
Run interactively (and stop on exit from command shell);
for convenience I keep this in a script, "runportal":
```
  docker run --name arcgis-portal \
  -it --rm -p 7080:7080 -p 7443:7443 --net arcgis-network \
  geoceg/portal-for-arcgis bash
```
